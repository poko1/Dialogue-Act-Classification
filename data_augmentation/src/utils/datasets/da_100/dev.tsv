s	i cant discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  wrong by a lot of people
s	im having a bad day
s	i was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and i remembered that he likes wine
s	but still i feel this connection with my exboyfriend and i feel like he does too
s	i feel tired
s	i noticed lately that ive been thinking a lot about death
s	even now i hear it saying every word inm thinking
s	however my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends
s	i just had a newborn
s	i want to get along as much as possible and he agreed
s	he used to be so madly in love with me but now it seems like he couldnt care less
s	i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust
s	as she finds each card she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away
s	i want someone to love and someone to love me
s	its causing depression stress and anxiety
s	my daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying calm down when she dropped her phone
s	he is only one who can take me on base in order to get a new id so i can continue to see doctor
s	bernadette peters makes an interesting appearance as a saloon girl who attracts aarons attention
s	i dont know how to tell someone how i feel about them
s	we do not live together
s	lucas denied this saying spielberg was protecting him
s	he masturbates daily even when i am lying in bed sleeping beside him
s	he got tired and left
s	nothing weve tried has worked so far
s	its bothering both of us
s	ok i love bad horror
s	i am upset
s	i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally
s	im just not happy with my marriage
s	soon after i experienced a miscarriage
s	of all of these only the battle of yellow tavern can be considered a clear union victory
s	i asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and i cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking
s	she is very familyoriented while all of my family left me on my butt abused ignored and messed up with me mentally
s	i am in my late teens and i have been living with him for most of our relationship
s	he says i complain too much about what hes doing
s	i know all marriages have problems but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust
s	she calls me horrible names and she pushes my buttons to the point i call her names
s	i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core
s	i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them
s	somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works
s	i dont know what to do
s	my parents say i should just let my daughter live with her dad but i dont see how i could fix things if i only see her every other weekend
s	after about the 10th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny
s	weve been together two years and have identified this as our main problem
s	we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other
s	i have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids
s	i forgave him for what he did in the past and he says hes sorry and he really loves me
s	i never had any from my birth
s	i keep on begging him to come back
s	he never has anything to say about me until i tell him something about himself
s	i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced
s	felinni would have filmed it had he the wicked wit
s	she and mr reynolds play one dimensional characters
s	there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife
s	hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why
s	he subsequently becomes obsessed with moe and his betrayal even having a hallucination where he sees moes face everywhere
s	the problem is that i will feel guilty
s	the track reached the kingston union station in november 1872
s	i find myself crying over every little thing like dropping a glass of water
s	we havent been getting along since i was a teenager
s	i stress over everything
s	i am married but i had sex with my friend
s	i last selfharmed a week ago
s	ive had several attempts at relationships and they all fail
s	after six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started
s	i got into a relationship with this guy
s	the idea excites me to no end but i donnt want to because it disgusts me
s	i enjoy it very much
s	a few nights ago i talked to this girl i know about my self esteem issues for the first time
s	the unit claimed 200 soviet tanks and 150 soviet aircraft destroyed for 41 losses
s	my girlfriend screams at me all the time and sometime i dont know how to deal with life
s	its been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent
s	obviously that wasnt the right choice
s	i have a son and i got really big when i was pregnant
s	theres this girl ive been dating for months
s	i am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues
s	before i got paid i told him i would have 2500 which i thought i would
s	i live with my mother currently while i get on my feet and hes living with some friends
s	were in an eight year relationship
s	in the passage outside the american room is a portrait of the philosopher jeanjacques rousseau by allan ramsay
s	i didnt load it with rocks and go mountain rucking
s	i feel like i failed myself
s	the other night i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing
s	he talks badly about me to his friends
s	alexa i love and miss my ex so much
s	he doesnt even care
s	i believe its because im not as social as him
s	i want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time i am busy thinking about sex
s	they have your typical movie personalities
s	hes such a good person
s	i dont know why i feel this way but i hate it
s	i never knew my father
s	it also foreshadows the design of stanes armor
s	they thought i was crazy but they decided to humour me
s	she has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and im her caregiver
s	and there are many
s	subbu also starred in the film alongside pushpavalli and m s sundari bai
s	i am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and im behind on the bills
s	in latin and slavic documents it was mentioned as moldova moldava or moldavia
s	my mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back and i cant seem to forgive her
s	lewis bradford then bought the house in 1972 and had the exterior sandblasted
s	then when i cut myself we talked on skype
s	i recently found out he cheated on me with another women
s	the exwife minimizes it by saying that he has repented
s	my fiance suffers from severe anxiety and depression
s	hes cheated and lied
s	she said she loves me but is not in love anymore
s	this film does not flatter wayne who seems way out of his element
s	i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school
s	after napoleons second and final defeat some are said to have accompanied him to his exile on saint helena
s	ive never thought about men until a week ago
s	we got engaged a little after 5 years of being together
s	my issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself
s	being human i think of myself as a monster
s	he applauded the episodes roleswitching allowing scully to be the believer and mulder to be the skeptic
s	at the beginning of our relationship i was unfaithful and she caught me cheating
s	we just had a baby seven months ago and never got along with my mother who ive lived with for years
s	the person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye
s	i dont know why i feel like this
s	im now in my 20s and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s
s	i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it
s	gilliam also injured himself when he went horseback riding
s	there was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out
s	i found myself starting to skip paragraphs then entire pages hoping something interesting would happen
s	yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about
s	i listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel
s	he always says i am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings
s	we had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out
s	i have tried this for him but i dont like it and have told him so
s	one week we were fine and the next he told me he needed space
s	he is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but i dont really believe him
s	i put 100 in to every thing
s	we have been together for about 5 months
s	this has made life difficult to say the least
s	for example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy
s	on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs
s	im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants
s	i always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life
s	then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm
s	i felt too old to listen to them
s	they also have a daughter together
s	she just wants me to support the sorority but its so hard
s	i want her to stay
s	i am torn on how to feel about it
s	i have three siblings
s	but then story started to unfold and the characters played beautifully by the two boys
s	sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious
s	im trying to make marriage work after a split
s	so fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the palm springs international film festival
s	my mom and i have been fighting a lot now and i just want a good relationship with her
s	nothing has changed and i feel hopeless
s	i dont know how to bring it up to my parents and that makes me miserable
s	severe crop damage to orange trees was also reported
s	ive never felt like i belong ive missed my country every second in the past four months and im just miserable
s	the problem is my fianc is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child
s	germany is the country i tolerate
s	she doesnt know why
s	henll tell me that hell stop lying and while hens saying that hes hiding something or lying about something
s	my wife works late most days so im lonely
s	im dating a guy i really love
s	i feel like no one understands
s	i cut myself for my climax during sex
s	i am afraid for my daughters safety
s	the challenge as always was trying to find one in my price range that met my requirements
s	schuyler went on to become one of the major leaders in suppressing the rebellion
s	shes in her early 20s and she has a toddler
s	she turned out to be kind of crazy so i decided to stop talking to her
s	he says he loves me  but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction
s	however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time
s	my mother is 100 codependent on me and is extremely manipulative
s	i crossdress and i dont know how to feel about it
s	they are hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language
s	he was only talking with her because he thought we were going to have a break up
s	im afraid of continuing because my depression is getting worse
s	i was an unwilling participant
s	i have been dating my exboyfriendns cousin for a few years
s	it is creating a wall in my current relationship
s	i also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but i cant get it out of my head
s	i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too
s	on the other hand i do not want my children to get hurt
s	the next morning she apologizes constantly until she feels validated
s	i dont know what to do any more
s	as the villain lord shouldnt expect to leave the beeb anytime soon
s	my daughter blames me and swears she hates me
s	its almost as if it went bad as in milk thats past the date
s	hes sick in the head
s	i have been having a lot of nightmares where i am being killed in different ways
s	she forgave me for what ive done to her and since then i been completely faithful
s	we hung out constantly and skyped to sleep every single night
s	im completely in love with her and im in extreme pain
s	in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs
s	thus the country was divided on the eve of the ottoman invasion despite ivan shishmans claims in his royal charters
s	but since its such a new disorder i cant find any information about it
s	that phrase makes me crazy
s	atlantis brings back the magic of the disney classics such as the lion king or alladin
s	when i am stressed overwhelmed hurt or angry the urge to selfharm is all i can think of
s	every medicine i have been on my body rejects i get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth
s	hes working on them and has improved
s	i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal
s	he led the club to the seventh place in the cheshire league and to the manchester challenge shield title
s	i keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations
s	he is a very open and straightforward person so he is getting upset with me for my lack of proper communication
s	all handwritten material was preserved and multiple copies of printed material were kept
s	cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters i decided not to break up the family
s	now this event is tearing us apart
s	my boyfriend says he doesnt like to do things with me because we fight too much
s	i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something
s	he said he would try and he never did
s	we were all together and our spouses were out of the room
s	we dont have sex anymore which bothers me tremendously
s	he has another child from a woman he was dating
s	hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what nature does in disposing of the weak
s	after that i was fine for a couple of years
s	i dont know what it is but its driving me crazy
s	i know what im doing wrong and i do it anyway just hoping things will change
s	im having issues with my relative
s	i had a baby about 2 months ago and i really havent been feeling myself
s	i just want answers
s	weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out
s	but no one was better at wounded idealism on dangerous ground or the psychic pain of this movie
s	i am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life
s	i want our family to be together and happy
s	he said he will call me soon
s	once i got there everything was fine again
s	i started out already liking tim robbins and loving scifi
s	when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something
s	i want to be better for myself and them
s	i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away
s	im a 40 year old male and having erection problems
s	its a snap to clean the bin and so far i am satisfied with my new tyson dc07
s	i took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes
s	i instantly started to cry
s	she has had a hysterectomy and she has a bad knee
s	that same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed
s	we need the full credit card details address 
s	i dont like being in pictures and always scribble out my face
s	i am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesnt care as well as most other people in my life
s	i suffer from adult adhd anxiety disorder and depression
s	i have a son with my girlfriend but she is emotionally abusive
s	this is a great led flashlight for 18 including the batteries
s	i have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man
s	in the past i have even cheated on my boyfriend while i was under the influence of alcohol
s	she hasnt been supportive of me in the past and she isnt someone that i feel comfortable opening up to
